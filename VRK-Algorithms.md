## Analysis of Algorithms | Set 1 (Asymptotic Analysis)

#### Why performance analysis?

* There are many important things that should be taken care of, like user friendliness, modularity, security, maintainability, etc. 
* **Why to worry about performance?**
* The answer to this is simple, we can have all the above things only if we have performance. So performance is like currency through which we can buy all the above things. Another reason for studying performance is – speed is fun!
To summarize, performance == scale. Imagine a text editor that can load 1000 pages, but can spell check 1 page per minute OR an image editor that takes 1 hour to rotate your image 90 degrees left OR … you get it. If a software feature can not cope with the scale of tasks users need to perform – it is as good as dead.

#### Given two algorithms for a task, how do we find out which one is better?
